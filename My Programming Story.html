                In 2015 I embarked on my first of many solo overseas journeys to Oslo, Norway. It was a life changing
                experience, not to sound cliche. The only thing on my mind when I got back was how can I get back there?
                I had 2 problems. First, I didn't have the job qualifications they wanted in order for me to obtain a 
                visa. Secondly, I didn't have money saved up so that I could live there for an extended period of time
                without working. The only thing on my mind was how can I make money and travel at the same time?
