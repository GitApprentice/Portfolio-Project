                In 2015 I embarked  to Oslo, Norway for my first of many solo overseas journeys. It was a life changing
                experience, not to sound cliche. The only thing on my mind when I got back was how can I get back there?
                I had 2 problems. First, I didn't have the job qualifications they wanted in order for me to obtain a 
                visa. Secondly, I didn't have money saved up so that I could live there for an extended period of time
                without working. The only thing on my mind was how can I make money and travel at the same time?

                One morning while driving for Uber in order to save up for my next trip to Sweden I got a request to pick
                up a guy around my age who was heading to work. While driving him around we just made the usual chit chat.
                He told me he was a software developer and explained to me a little bit about it. I told him after my last
                trip I was dying to find a way to work remotely so I could travel more consistently and make money at the
                same time. He told me that anything in the coding field would be great for that. He explained to me a 
                little about his story, how he got started and how he was able to break into the field and get employed.
                Before I dropped him off we exchanged emails and he sent me some links to free material online that I 
                could use to get started learning.

                When I got home I opened up and created an account for the website that he recommended the most, 
                Codecademy. I instantly got started and began studying the basics of HTML and CSS. I blew through HTML 
                and CSS and thought the rest would be just as much of a breeze, what was I thinking. I then moved on to
                the basics of Javascript and moved through that pretty well with a good understanding. I had heard about
                Python from a friend in software development and tried to give that a whirl. I learned very quickly that 
                back-end development was not an interest for me. Prior to learning coding I had taken a course in digital
                marketing and it really peaked my interest. I really enjoyed learning about techniques in SEO and gaining
                views as well as seeing how powerful online business was and is still continuing to become! Because of 
                that I put my focus on front-end development. Learning Javascript libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, React, 
                and Angular. Putting together nice, clean looking websites that accomplish needs for businesses and 
                individuals is something that has meaning to me and leaves me feeling truly satisfied at the end of a job.
