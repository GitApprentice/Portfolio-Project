                        I'm looking to consistently grow as a developer. I don't see getting a
                        job in this industry as the finish line. In an ever changing industry I
                        don't think a finish line truly exists, constant learning and adapting is 
                        required. I want to be able to acquire more knowledge everyday so that I 
                        can get to a point where I can see the big picture of situations and learn 
                        how to apply knowledge on the fly without having to turn to other people
                        or the internet.

                        One of the biggest appeals to me with web design is the common ability to be
                        able to work remotely. The idea of location independence really appeals to me. 
                        I understand that for some companies they would like their new developers to 
                        be on-site for a while before going remote. I totally understand and am willing
                        to compromise with that, but ultimately I would like to eventually go fully 
                        remote once mutual comfort with that work set-up is built.

                        Meaning is something that is super important to me. Working at a job just simply
                        for the sake of working at a job is not something I can do long term. There has to
                        be some type of bigger purpose that is a part of the job. Technology has been something
                        that has completely revolutionized the world. I'd like to be part of that and help
                        businesses and individuals alike.

                        When I come to work I work hard and give it my whole focus. However, in 
                        complete transparency, with finally entering into this career field after 
                        years of hard work to get here I do want time to be able to enjoy it. I 
                        think a good work/life balance is very important to productivity at the 
                        workplace. Don't worry, I definitely expect more work than play and will not
                        be requesting 15 hour work weeks.
